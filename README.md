Introduction
============

Simple Android application which allows small businesses (or household employers) to keep track of their employees 'timecards'.  Allows addition, update, deletion of employee records and a brief profile to include hourly pay rate, time units, overtime, etc.  Timecards are displayed on weekly basis. 

All data stored in SQLite locally.  Functionality to email data off device exists.

Installation
============

APK available in Downloads section. Also feel free to rip source code in accordance with MIT/BSD license.

Usage

Install APK as desired.  Interface is very straightforward.  If you're going to compile locally, please include JodaTime (http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/) JAR.

Policy

TODO
====

I might revisit this concept later, time permitting.
